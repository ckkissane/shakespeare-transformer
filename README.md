# Shakespeare Transformer

A decoder only transformer trained on the works on shakespeare. This is a suggested exercise from chapter 1
of this [deep_learning_curriculum](https://github.com/jacobhilton/deep_learning_curriculum/blob/master/1-Transformers.md). 

Here is a sample from the model at the end of training:

```
O my sweet Cordelia, true love,
Thick, for my love and subdued’d,
Hourly love’s best exercise, and deadly
Beat all the rout, holds the wings and green.
O Romeo! the devil fire in heaven doth love.
If e’er the fault should be near, be refused.
```

# To reproduce

Run the training script:

```
python train_shakespeare.py
```
